    <strong> Shih Tzu (pronounced in the West “sheed-zoo” or “sheet-su”; the Chinese say “sher-zer”), weighing between 9 to 16 pounds,
and standing between 8 and 11 inches, are surprisingly solid for dogs their size. The coat, which comes in many colors,
is worth the time you will put into it—few dogs are as beautiful as a well-groomed Shih Tzu.
Being cute is a way of life for this lively charmer. The Shih Tzu is known to be especially affectionate with children.
As a small dog bred to spend most of their day inside royal palaces, they make a great pet if you live in an apartment or lack a big backyard.
Some dogs live to dig holes and chase cats, but a Shih Tzu’s idea of fun is sitting in your lap acting adorable as you try to watch TV.

<strong> Shih tzus might be tiny in size, but they're big on personality. Wanting nothing more than to be your best friend, this pint-sized pooch is an affectionate, lively and sweet-tempered companion.
Most fanciers agree the shih tzu hails from ancient China, where for more than 1,000 years royalty regarded these lap dogs as cherished household pets.
In the 1940s, the shih tzu (whose name means "lion" in Mandarin Chinese), began appearing in the United States when World War II veterans brought them home from overseas.
Today the shih tzu consistently ranks as one of the top ten most popular dogs in the country, according to American Kennel Club registration statistics. Buts the shih tzu right for you?
Life's a game. And the shih tzu loves playing it with you!
Whether the day's activity is splashing in the pool on a hot summer afternoon or playing an indoor game of hide-and-go-seek, the shih tzu is up for doing just anything.
Don't let their diminutive size and good looks fool you into thinking they're only lap warmers and show dogs. These little lions like to go for walks and if they don't get them, they're likely to spend time chasing their tails around the house  They also successfully compete in the challenging sport of agility, where dogs navigate a timed obstacle course with their owners' help.
No matter what game you chose to play, as long as you enjoy it your shih tzu probably will

    <strong> 1. The Breed Is More Than 1,000 Years Old
Documentation of the Shih Tzu goes back at least 1,000 years. The breed’s ancestry goes back even further than that.
 Records show that short, square, “under the table” dogs existed in China as early as 1,000 B.C. These short and stout pooches were likely the ancestors of the Shih Tzu.
2. They Came From Tibet
People commonly associate the Shih Tzu with China, but they actually came from China’s western neighbor, Tibet, which was a sovereign nation until the 1950s.
Tibet probably sent dogs to the Chinese royalty as gifts. The Chinese then bred them with Pekingese or Pugs to create the modern day Shih Tzu.
3. Their Name Means “Little Lion”
The Mandarin phrase “Shih Tzu” translates to little lion. The Shih Tzu was likely given this name because of its association with the Tibetan Buddhist God of Learning,
 who, according to legend, traveled with a small lion dog that could transform into a full-sized lion.

4. They Are Also Called “Chrysanthemum-Faced Dogs”
Shih Tzu are called “chrysanthemum-faced dogs” because the hair on their faces grows in every direction. Shih Tzu owners who keep their dogs clipped short know all too well that not much time goes by before a Shih Tzu’s hair grows up from her snout and in front of her eyes.
5. They Were Wiped Out During the Communist Revolution
When China underwent its Communist Revolution, the Shih Tzu breed all but disappeared.
This may not have actually been caused by communism; a contributing factor was the 1908 death of the Dowager Empress Tzu Hsi,
 who supervised a world-renown breeding programof Shih Tzu, Pekingese, and Pugs. When she died, the breeding program fell apart, and it became nearly impossible to get a Shih Tzu.
6. 14 Dogs Saved the Breed
Because their numbers dwindled down to almost nothing during the first half of the 20th century,
 every Shih Tzu alive today can be traced to one of 14 dogs — seven males and seven females — that were used to rebuild the breed.
7. Military Personnel Brought Them to the U.S.
After Shih Tzu were imported to England from China,
the English exported them to other countries in Europe. American soldiers stationed in European countries took Shih Tzu back to the United States with them in the late 1940s
and 1950s.

8. Many Celebrities Have Owned Shih Tzu
Since the Shih Tzu is one of the most popular dog breeds, it’s no surprise that many stars have owned them. Celebrity owners of Shih Tzu include Nicole Richie,
Mariah Carey, Beyoncé, Colin Farell, Bill Gates, and even Queen Elizabeth II.
9. Shih Tzu Are Glamorous . . . and Athletic
Given the long flowing coats of Shih Tzu show dogs, we tend to think of this breed as more glamorous than sporty.
 But underneath that gorgeous coat is a muscular body that can perform well in agility. Many Shih Tzu have won agility competitions.
 In 2014, a Shih Tzu became the first of his breed to win both a champion title and an agility title.
